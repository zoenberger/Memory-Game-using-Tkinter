# Memory-Game-using-Tkinter

REQUIREMENTS: Python3 only! 

I'm using Tkinter as the GUI, but I opted to not use anything else to keep it as compatible as possible. Tkinter does not support JPG images, so I only used GIFs to avoid needing an imaging package. You can add more GIF images (100px W by 150px H) to the GIF folder and they should automatically become part of game images. 

I made this same game using wxPython: https://github.com/zoenberger/Memory-Game-using-wxPython

However, as I'm not getting familiar with Tkinter, I remade it. I have to say, I prefer Tkinter. 

If you compare the code of both games, however, you'll see I had to do several things differently because Tkinter does not work with time.sleep delays. It's definitely better this way. 

Very basic right now. Prints total matches and total tries to console when finished. Lots of added functionality possible, so I'll tinker with it more down the road.
